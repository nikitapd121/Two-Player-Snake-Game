# Two-Player-Snake-Game
A 2-player snake game on a 1â€“100 grid. Players take turns rolling dice to reach 100. Red boxes mark snake heads (fall zones), and dark yellow boxes mark tails. Landing on a red box slides the player down to the tail. A mix of luck and strategy, this game offers engaging, color-coded gameplay with win-by-exact-score logic.
